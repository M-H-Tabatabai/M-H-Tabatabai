## About Me
- 🎓 Master's student in Software Engineering (Tarbiat Modares University) — currently ranked **#1** in the program.  
- 🔬 Research focus: Reinforcement Learning applied to financial markets — especially algorithmic trading in cryptocurrencies (robust agents under noise, latency, and transaction costs).  
- 🏅 Academic highlights: Earned **A** grades in Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning courses.  
- 💻 Primary programming language: **Python**. I build reproducible pipelines, custom Gym environments, and benchmark RL agents.

## Key Skills
**Technical**
- Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- Reinforcement Learning (policy & value methods), Stable-Baselines3, OpenAI Gym  
- Machine learning fundamentals, model evaluation & backtesting  
- Databases & SQL, data pipelines, Docker, Git / GitHub, CI (GitHub Actions)  

**Software Engineering**
- Algorithm design, system design basics, Agile & Scrum practices  
- Testing, reproducibility, packaging (pip-installable demos)

**Soft Skills**
- Discipline, responsibility, teamwork, problem solving, time management, creativity, eagerness to learn
